# Discovery Findings

## Overview
This document contains findings from the initial analysis of the IMAGO website and its current implementation.

## Website Analysis

### Current State
- **URL**: https://stock.imago-images.de (based on SSL certificate analysis)
- **Technology Stack**: Elasticsearch-based search system
- **Current Features**: Image search and storage with metadata

### Navigation Structure
Based on the data structure, the system appears to support:
- Search functionality with German and English analyzers
- Image browsing by various metadata fields
- Filtering by photographers, dates, and dimensions

### Content Types
- **Primary Content**: Stock photography images
- **Metadata Types**: 
  - Image dimensions (width/height)
  - Photographer information
  - Dates
  - Search text in multiple languages
  - Image numbers for unique identification

### User Experience Observations
- Search supports multilingual queries (German and English)
- Images have comprehensive metadata for filtering
- System handles over 1 million images (1,000,003 documents)

## Technical Discovery

### Frontend Architecture
Not directly visible from the data samples, but the system interfaces with Elasticsearch for search functionality.

### Backend Services
- **Search Engine**: Elasticsearch
- **Index Name**: "imago"
- **Data Storage**: ~277MB for 1M+ documents

### API Endpoints
Based on the samples.json structure, the API appears to use standard Elasticsearch query format with:
- Search endpoints returning paginated results
- Metadata fields exposed in search responses
- Standard Elasticsearch response structure

### Database Schema
From mapping.json analysis:
```json
{
  "bildnummer": integer (unique image ID)
  "datum": date field
  "suchtext": text with German/English analyzers
  "fotografen": keyword field
  "hoehe": integer (height)
  "breite": integer (width)
  "db": keyword (database identifier)
  "title": text field
  "description": text field
  "bearbeitet_bild": text field
}
```

## Business Logic

### Search Functionality
- Multilingual text search using specialized analyzers
- Full-text search on "suchtext" field
- Keyword search on photographer names
- Date-based filtering capabilities
- Dimension-based filtering (width/height)

### Content Management
- Images are indexed with comprehensive metadata
- Each image has a unique "bildnummer" identifier
- Images are associated with a database identifier ("db": "stock")
- Supports both title and description fields (though not populated in samples)

### User Workflows
1. Users can search images using text queries in German or English
2. Results can be filtered by photographer, date, or dimensions
3. Each result includes complete metadata for the image

## Key Findings Summary
1. **Large Dataset**: Over 1 million images indexed
2. **Elasticsearch Implementation**: Using standard Elasticsearch with custom mapping
3. **Multilingual Support**: Built-in support for German and English search
4. **Missing Metadata**: Title and description fields exist but are not populated
5. **Single Shard Configuration**: Yellow health status indicates replica issues
6. **Active Usage**: 14,687 queries performed with scroll operations for bulk exports

## Recommendations
1. Populate missing title and description fields for better SEO
2. Address the yellow cluster health status by configuring replicas
3. Implement structured data schemas for better search engine visibility
4. Add more granular categorization beyond just photographer and date
